## Web GUI for Intel Intrinsics Guide. ##

I was in desperate need for a good intrinsics guide with support for filtering but unfortunately [the one provided by Intel](http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-intrinsics-guide) looks [quite bad](http://i.imgur.com/f5rCCIt.png). 

This project is a simple [Web GUI](http://i.imgur.com/AIXxhQr.png) replacement of the official java application. No fancy stuff, only simple search and filtering by instruction set, type, category and return type.

Right now this GUI is not hosted anywhere, so you'd need to download and publish it yourself on your local webserver instance. It doesn't have any real dependencies (other than a few nuget packages) so it shouldn't be hard.
